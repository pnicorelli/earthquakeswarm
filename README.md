### What's that

This is a website player who fetch data from the [Italian institute INGV](http://www.ingv.it/en/) and displays in chronological order the seismic events.
**This is not intended for geologist professional use.** It's just a small project for a better understanding in how our planet works.

Data are collected from italian's seismographs so the events to much far from Italy are not displayed.

### Usage
Select a range date and a time speed then click on **Play**. If you play with defaults value you'll see events for the last week day by day.

- Dates are in month/day/year format!
